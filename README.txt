All your MCC files are saved in a temporary directory located at (CHANGE %USERNAME% TO YOUR USERNAME if you want to):
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\LocalLow\MCC\Temporary\UserContent

You DO NOT have to quit Halo MCC to put your files back in. Just copy them in the temporary folder and refresh Theater Mode (it should appear after)

Here's how it works:
- You run the script and it will create a folder called "MCC Films" on your Desktop.
- In "MCC Films" you will find multiple folders for each Halo, folders labeled by the DATE of your current session
- The script runs every 1 minute (or you can skip the 1 minute wait) then it does its thing.
- You can play and let the script run in the background. However, since MCC has some "issues" I recommend going into theater mode or "My Files, Films" every 8-10 games,
to force MCC to generate the films.
- The script WILL delete your films, but will put them in their respective folders. Do not worry if you can't watch a film right off the bat, it means it was
moved, you just have to stop the script and put your film back in the folder. (Will probably change it, or come up with a better solution)

!IMPORTANT!
- You cannot watch your clips like a normal video. They have a different format, specific for MCC. If you want to watch a film, simply copy your film and put
it in the folder mentioned above.
- MCC can only save up to 12 temporary films. This means for example if you have 8 films of Halo 3 and 4 films of Halo Reach, if you play
a game of Halo 3 it will remove the oldest file and create a new one for the most recent Halo you played.
- MCC will only detect 12 films when put in the temporary folder. Even if you put 100 films it will only show 12 in the game.
