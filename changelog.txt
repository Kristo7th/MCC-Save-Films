Version 1.2 (soon)
- Will change naming convention for all films. Right now a Halo Reach film for example saves its film file like this: asq_mglo-1_30_settle_82964039
That is Powerhouse. I already created the function which changes this format and it will look something like this: 
MAP - GAMETYPE - TIME - GAMERTAG = Guardian - Hardcore 2v2 - 5:45 PM - Kristo Rails.
There are +100 maps in MCC and each Halo has its own naming conventions when it comes to the films. I need to go through all of them and figure out
which one is which. Version 1.2 will have AT THE VERY LEAST Halo 3's films changed.
- Will update the carnage reports and will also add the XML carnage files for each game (for those who want to look at a more detailed report of their game)


Version 1.1
- Added carnage reports for each Halo (CE and Halo 2 included)
- Made some much needed improvements when it came to naming the files & folders


Version 1.0
- Public release
