Version 1.5
- Updated the naming for the Halo Reach and Halo 2A films. In the next update I will work on the carnage reports. It will generate a HTML file with
a detailed report (Team stats, red team MVP, blue team MVP, your stats, your medals)

Version 1.4
- Updated the naming for the films. The script would save all your films but would rename only one of them because the date would be the same for all.
What I did is I changed so that it adds the date it was created by MCC.

Version 1.3
- Added XML file carnage. This will help in a future update.

Version 1.2
- Made a function that changes the names from: asq_constru_AFDX into Construct 1 17 (hour and minute)

Version 1.1
- Added carnage reports for each Halo (CE and Halo 2 included)
- Made some much needed improvements when it came to naming the files & folders

Version 1.0
- Public release
